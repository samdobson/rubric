## What is Rubric?

Rubric allows **no-code automation of file and folder creation**.

## Who is Rubric for?

Rubric is for anyone wanting to:
* Create repeatable, standardised file and folder structures.
* Empower others to quickly and easily reuse these structures in a consistent way.

## How do I get started?

Rubric templates are created using your usual software. Getting started is a 2 step process:

1. Convert existing files into a template by inserting {{ placeholders }} 
in file contents, or in filenames or folder names.
2. List placeholder names in rubric.txt for users to insert their own values.
3. Share with your users, who can upload to:

Read the Quickstart guide for step-by-step instructions.

## For developers

Rubric runs on cookiecutter, and aims to be fully backward-compatible. That means that:

* **Cookiecutter creators** can enable UI-based usage of their template
by adding a badge to README.md
