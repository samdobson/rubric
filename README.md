## What is Rubric?

Rubric allows **no-code automation of file and folder creation**.

## Who is Rubric for?

Rubric is for anyone wanting to:
* Create repeatable, standardised file and folder structures.
* Empower others to quickly and easily reuse these structures in a consistent way.

## How do I get started?

Rubric templates are created with your usual software. Getting started is a 2 step process:

1. Convert existing files to a template by inserting {{ placeholders }} 
in file contents, or in filenames or folder names.
2. List placeholder names in rubric.txt for users to insert their own values.
3. Zip and share with your users, who can complete rubric.txt and upload to:

Read the Quickstart guide for step-by-step instructions.

## For developers

Rubric runs on a fork of cookiecutter and aims to be fully backward-compatible. This means that:

* **Cookiecutter users** can generate projects with no Python installatiom and without touching a CLI.
* **Cookiecutter maintainers** can support this by adding a badge to README.md
